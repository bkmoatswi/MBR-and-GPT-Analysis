# MBR-and-GPT-Analysis

## Objective

The main goal of this room is to understand and analyze the differences between MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning schemes on disks. I learn how to identify and work with both types of partition tables, explored their structure, and understanding their advantages and limitations


## Skills Learned
 
I Learned how MBR and GPT partition tables are structured.

Analyze disks using forensic  tools HxD and FTK Imager to identify partition types.

Learned key differences such as maximum partition size, number of partitions supported, and boot capabilities.

I practiced converting disks between MBR and GPT formats.


 I learned how to use FTK Imager forensic tool to recover or examine a disk image's contents

## Tool Proficiency
### Gain hands-on experience with:

HxD Hex Editor

FTK Imager


## Achiement

Succefully completed the MBR-and-GPT-Analysis
